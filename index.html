<p>We believe that this racist government has robbed us and now we are demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and two mules. Forty acres and two mules was promised 100 years ago as redistribution for slave labor and mass murder of Black people. </p>
<p>We will accept the payment in currency which will be distributed to our many communities: <em>the Germans are now aiding the Jews in Israel for genocide of the Jewish people.</em> The Germans murdered <strong>6,000,000 Jews</strong>. The American racist has taken part in the slaughter of over <strong><em>50,000,000 Black people</em></strong>; therefore, we feel that this is a modest demand that we make.</p>
